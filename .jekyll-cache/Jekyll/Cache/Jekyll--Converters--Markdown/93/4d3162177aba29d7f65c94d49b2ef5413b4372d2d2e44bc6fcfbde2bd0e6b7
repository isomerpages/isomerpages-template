I"f<p>‘Ask Jamie’ is a virtual assistant (VA) that can be implemented on agency websites and trained to be able to answer queries within specific domains. When activated on a website, a chat window will open to allow the public to ‘chat’ with Jamie, very much like how one would chat on instant messaging.</p>

<p>‘Ask Jamie’ leverages on its Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine to understand the questions typed by the public and respond with an appropriate answer. When an answer entails multiple permutations, ‘Ask Jamie’ can be trained to ask follow-on questions to narrow down the answer to one that is specifically relevant to the context of the end-user.</p>

<p>Other key features of ‘Ask Jamie’ include cross-agency queries which eliminates the need for the public to know which agency websites to go to for specific queries, escalation to ‘live’ chat to allow the public to continue a conversation seamlessly while getting help from a real person and answering questions by leveraging on an agency backend database, the Gov iFAQ system and the Wolfram Alpha general knowledge database.</p>
