I"”<p>The Singapore Industrial &amp; Services Employees Union applied to the Court for an order against First Defense Services Pte Ltd to show cause why the Company should not be ordered to comply with the Courtâ€™s award made on 28 March 2013.</p>

<p>The Union claimed that 10 out of the 41 affected employees had not received the salary increment awarded by the Court. The Company argued that it had complied with the Courtâ€™s award as it had, over the period October 2011 to September 2013, given these employees salary increments which were in excess of the amounts awarded by the Court.</p>

<p>The Court ruled that as the monthly basic salary of each of the 10 employees exceeded the employeeâ€™s salary as at July 2011 plus the Court-awarded increment, the Company had complied with the Courtâ€™s award. The employees had also been paid the back-payments of salary, overtime and AWS that were due to them.</p>
