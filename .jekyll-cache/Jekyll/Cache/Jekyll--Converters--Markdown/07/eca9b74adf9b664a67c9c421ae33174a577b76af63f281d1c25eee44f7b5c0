<p>Is ownership of public housing a sure win for financial gain? Will chances of returning to crime be reduced with greater social acceptance of ex-offenders? These were some ideas from participating teams at the finals of Government Technology Agency (GovTech)‚Äôs inaugural National Data Visualisation Video Challenge held today.</p>

<p>The Challenge, themed ‚ÄúHow Open Data makes a difference for you and me‚Äù, saw over 80 submissions by more than 200 students from Universities, Polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education (ITE). Following eight months of preparation and selection, 12 teams made it to the finals to create a video with data visualisation to share how open data could improve lives.</p>

<p>Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Ministry of Communications and Information &amp; Ministry of Education, and Minister-in-charge of GovTech, was the Guest-of-Honour for the Finals. Dr Janil presented prizes to the top three winning teams.</p>

<p>The 12 teams used a myriad of open government datasets, including the number of seniors and locations of eldercare services, data on water consumption and water supply sources as well as recidivism rates to draw out interesting insights and present them through a video story.</p>

<p>From the datasets, the teams unearthed new insights such as the towns in Singapore that would require more eldercare facilities, the pressing need for water conservation in Singapore, and the importance of social acceptance to prevent ex-offenders from re-offending.</p>

<p>The Challenge, supported by six industry partners namely Amazon Web Services, Carousell, Cloudera, Microsoft, Google and The Straits Times, also displayed ability of students to cross-analyse data and come up with tools such as automating the income growth and key expenses of users until their selected retirement age. Please see <a href="/files/2017-09-30/Annex 1.pdf">Annex 1</a> for more details on the projects.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúIt was a chance for us to showcase our creativity through data analysis and we learnt a lot from the Challenge.‚Äù

<p>Ms Jacqueline Poh, Chief Executive, GovTech, and one of the judges in the Finals, said, ‚ÄúI am impressed with the videos and encouraged by the strong support from industry partners. Aimed at driving Singapore‚Äôs open data movement, this Challenge brought together students from different tertiary institutions in Singapore, and enabled them to see the usefulness of the open government data that is available to the public. GovTech will continue to cultivate this culture of co-creation with our citizens and industry.‚Äù</p>

<p>Ms Wang Zejia of Team TongQiang, formed by two female undergraduates from National University of Singapore, said, ‚ÄúThe Challenge allowed us to freely explore data and find meaningful use of data to improve our daily lives.‚Äù Team N.I.C.E., one of the three ITE finalist teams, said, ‚ÄúIt was a chance for us to showcase our creativity through data analysis and we learnt a lot from the Challenge.‚Äù</p>

<p>In line with Singapore‚Äôs Smart Nation vision, the Challenge encourages greater use of open government data, starting with students, to raise awareness, catalyse innovation and create greater economic value.</p>

<p>Launched in 2011, the country‚Äôs open government portal, data.gov.sg, was enhanced in late 2015 and has seen an increase of 40% in unique monthly visitors to about 94,000 in the last year. The number of quality datasets have also increased to 1,200 since inception. These datasets are available to citizens, developers, researchers and students to develop new ideas and make better use of open government data.</p>
