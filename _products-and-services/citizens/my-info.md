[MyInfo](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/myinfo/intro){:target="_blank"} is a one-stop data platform that saves time by automatically filling out government e-forms. After creating a profile, clicking the ‘Retrieve MyInfo’ button located on the forms of participating digital services will populate the forms with data from the profile, making government transactions easier than ever. 

Consent is sought from users before any data is transferred. Users can even choose to be alerted whenever a digital service uses their personal data. 

SingPass holders will be able to use the MyInfo feature on digital services that pertain to every Singaporean, with even more being added over time. These digital services currently include: 

* Applying for Polytechnics
* Applying for the Baby Bonus scheme 
* Applying for flats 
* Updating contact details

For a list of digital services with the MyInfo feature please see the MyInfo [FAQ](http://www.ifaq.gov.sg/MyInfo/apps/fcd_faqmain.aspx#FAQ_169237){:target="_blank"} page.
