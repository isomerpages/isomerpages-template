![Smart Nation Fellowship]({{"/images/programmes/products-and-services/SNFP_web banner.png" | absolute_url }})

Singapore is embarking on a journey to become the world’s first Smart Nation, with the aim of harnessing technology and data to improve the lives of citizens. As we build a Smart Nation, Singapore needs to develop a strong nucleus of innovative engineering and technology talent within the government who are able to leverage cutting edge technology trends and build meaningful digital and data solutions that can help improve the lives of citizens.

In support of this whole-of-nation effort, the Smart Nation Fellowship Programme was launched to recruit top data scientists and technologists from academia and industry to join the Singapore government for 3-6 month stints. They will work alongside data scientists and product developers from GovTech, as well as users and developers from different government agencies, to apply data science and technology for the public good.

Fellows will get the opportunity to work on projects that have potential impact on public policy decision-making and operations, or public service delivery. They can either choose to work on digital and data projects that have been pre-identified, or propose new projects. These will include building transformational digital services apps and data analytics platforms.

If you have what it takes and have a strong desire to contribute to building the world’s first Smart Nation, we welcome you to apply to the fellowship programme.
