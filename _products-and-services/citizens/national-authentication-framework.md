The National Authentication Framework (NAF) seeks to realise the vision of the iN2015 masterplan for a secure and trusted enabling infocomm infrastructure that can facilitate the delivery of online services by the public and private sectors.

With the increased availability of online services offered by key sectors such as banking & finance, Government and healthcare, NAF can safeguard against unauthorised access to sensitive information available online, such as bank account details, securities trading account details or electronic health records. The NAF will be a timely nationwide strong authentication infrastructure that can provide consumers greater assurance when performing online transactions.

### **Strategic Objectives**

The NAF aims to facilitate a nationwide common platform for strong authentication that will:

1. Enable consumers to enjoy the convenience of using a single authentication device to access multiple online services that require strong authentication;

2. Enable businesses to enjoy cost savings when they leverage on NAF instead of implementing their own strong authentication systems;

3. Boost online trust and confidence, thus helping to entrench Singapore's status as a trusted infocomm hub; and

4. Enhance protection against online identity theft for online services for both consumers and online business owners.
