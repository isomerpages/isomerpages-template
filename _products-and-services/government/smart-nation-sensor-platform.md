Singapore is building a Smart Nation by harnessing technology to the fullest with the aim of improving the lives of citizens, creating more opportunities, and building stronger communities.

With a conducive ecosystem that attracts industries and talents to join us on our journey, we can co-create a Smart Nation together. This also involves good governance, infrastructure, and boosting our capabilities.

A Smart Nation means people and businesses are empowered through increased access to data, more participatory through the contribution of innovative ideas and solutions, and a more anticipatory government that utilises technology to better serve citizens’ needs.

### **Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP)**
Smart Nation is also built upon collection of data and the ability to make sense of information. Insights gathered from data will then contribute to forming solutions that can help improve lives.

Smart Nation Sensor Platform will be one of the anchor initiatives that will enable everyone and everything, everywhere, to be connected all the time in Singapore. Pervasive connectivity, along with infrastructure and common technical architecture will allow citizens, businesses and government agencies to leverage technology towards improving lives in a Smart Nation.
