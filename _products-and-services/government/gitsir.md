Government IT Security Incident Response (GITSIR) Team was formed to support the IT Security Incident Framework for the Government. It serves as a primary point of contact for all security incidents in the Government and serves as a central interface for coordinating with external parties such as other government agencies, external organisations, Internet Service Providers and law enforcement.

GITSIR offers technical assistance and advice on investigating, resolving and recovering from security incidents. To minimise and prevent incidents, GITSIR also proactively provides Incidents Knowledge Base (include technical advisories, patches, tools, incident statistic and trend etc) and enrichment programmes to increase the level of incident response capability of the Government offices.
