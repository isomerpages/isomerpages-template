The Networked Trade Platform (NTP) is a national trade information management platform that provides the foundation for Singapore to be the world's leading trade, supply chain and trade financing hub. At its core, it represents a concerted effort to drive an industry-wide digital transformation to build a trade and logistics IT ecosystem which connects businesses, community systems and platforms and government systems.

Its vision is to be a national trade info-ecosystem that provides the foundation for Singapore to be the world's leading trade, supply chain and trade financing hub. Replacing TradeNet for trade-related applications and TradeXchange for connecting the trade and logistics community, the NTP is designed to provide beyond the service offerings of the incumbent systems. Specifically, it aims to be a:

-One-stop trade information management system linked to other platforms
-Next-generation platform offering a wide range of trade-related services
-Open innovation platform allowing development of insights & new services with cross-industry data
-Document hub for digitisation at source that enables reuse of data to cut costs and streamline processes
