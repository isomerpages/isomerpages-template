The Business Grants Portal (BGP) is a one-stop portal for businesses to apply for grants according to their needs without having to approach multiple agencies. The BGP was officially launched in January 2017. 	

The key features of the BGP are:
* **Streamlined application forms**
<br/>Application forms and the data that agencies need have been streamlined. Businesses can apply for grants easily through a simple application process.

* **Routing of applications to the relevant agency**
<br/>BGP is designed to route applications to the relevant agency based on user inputs, so businesses need not worry if they do not know which agency to approach for grant support.

* **Simplifying the process of providing company related information**
<br/>Key company information will be automatically extracted from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authorityâ€™s (ACRA) database, based on the registered Unique Entity Number (UEN) of the applicant company. In addition, the portal will store relevant company information provided in previous grant applications for re-use in subsequent grant applications.
