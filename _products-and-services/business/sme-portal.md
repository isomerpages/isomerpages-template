The [SME Portal](https://www.smeportal.sg/content/smeportal/en/home.html){:target="_blank"} (formerly known as the EnterpriseOne Portal) is the first stop for Singapore SME owners and aspiring entrepreneurs looking for information, tools and services that can help them build sustainable and competitive businesses. Serving the business community since 2006, the Portal has been enhanced over the years to meet the changing needs of SMEs.

### Support for Your Businesses

Through collaborations between SPRING Singapore, government agencies and over 30 industry partners, the Portal now offers useful government and commercial information and services for SMEs at various business stages. This includes centralised information on government assistance schemes, industry insights and exclusive offers on business solutions. The Portal also serves as a point of access to key government e-services such as GeBiz Alerts and other commercial resources.

Users can also create an account to receive personalised information and services based on their interests and business needs. With an SME Portal account, users can also connect with like-minded individuals across industries to achieve common business goals.
