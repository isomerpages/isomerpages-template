CorpPass is a corporate digital identity for businesses and other entities (such as non-profit organisations and associations) to transact with Government agencies online. Owned by the Ministry of Finance and managed by Government Technology Agency (GovTech), CorpPass marks the first time that the Government is rolling out a single corporate digital identity. This creates opportunities for even more services and transactions to be provided online conveniently and securely. 

#### **Greater Convenience, Better Control and Enhanced Privacy**
Businesses currently conduct business transactions through multiple digital identities such as SingPass and EASY. Having a single corporate digital identity will increase convenience for users who transact with multiple government agencies, as they no longer need to handle multiple login IDs. CorpPass will also allow businesses to have greater control, as they will be able to grant and manage employeesâ€™ access to Government digital services.

The Government has received feedback from the business community that SingPass should only be used for personal transactions, and not corporate transactions, due to privacy concerns. For instance, employees who go on leave tend to share their personal SingPass IDs and passwords with colleagues to help carry out business transactions like filing corporate tax, or applying for permits and licences. Having separate login IDs for corporate and personal matters will therefore better protect information of both businesses and employees.

Developed in consultation with industry partners and pilot users, CorpPass has been rolled out since September 2016, and more than 130 government digital services are now using CorpPass as a login method. By Q3 2018, CorpPass will be the only login method for online corporate transactions with the Government.
